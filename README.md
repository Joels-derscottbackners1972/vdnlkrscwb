just walked out of Screamboat... omg my head's still buzzing like a microwave with a fork in it. theater was so loud, almost felt like the popcorn was popping directly in my ears. the guy next to me was snoring through the slow parts—like, dude, the boat was literally screaming, how do you snooze through that?? lol

the plot was like spaghetti thrown at a wall. bits stuck, some flopped. was the ghost real, or just a metaphor? idk... but the girl with the red shoes and the hair like seaweed kept appearing like she was someone's faded memory or a lost sock. saw some popcorn crumbs on my shirt. do these multiply on their own? maybe they attended the   too, 😂

> there was this insane scene, like a fever dream, you know? the lead was just yelling at a mirror and the reflection was doing jazz hands behind his back... WHAT is that supposed to mean!? guess i gotta 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   to pause and figure it out. or just press rewind on my brain.

that twist tho... felt like they were just tossing plot points like confetti. never seen anything like it. am i supposed to be shocked or just confused?? back's aching from this seat like it’s been chewed on by a wild raccoon. who designs these seats, really... who?

oh did i mention the boat was legit terrifying? like, imagine if the Titanic had a baby with a haunted house and the nanny was Dracula? you just HAVE to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   for that scene where the propeller moves like it’s got a mind of its own. who comes up with this stuff?? man, forgot to reply to the one who asked me to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  . lol oops

soundtrack was either stolen from a rollercoaster ride or composed in a blender. wish i had music like that to pump up a grocery store shift. would've made the vegetable aisle a disco inferno yesterday. instead, just awkward silences and beeping at the checkout...

can't shake the feeling, the  ’s just like a weird dream you have when you're feverish, and wake up with no idea where you are. please tell me seeing a boat yelling isn't normal—or is it? this 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 fringes on absurd... or am i the absurd one?? existential crisis...

return 0;
static int confusion[]; // what was i even trying to say?
} // end of weirdly coded thought, i guess?
